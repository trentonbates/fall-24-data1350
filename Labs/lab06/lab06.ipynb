Here, since larger values of the test statistic suggest the alternative model (where the chance of guessing the correct hand is something other than 50%), we can formalize our analysis by finding what proportion of simulated statistics were as large or larger than our observed test statistic (the area at or to the right of the observed test statistic). If this area is small enough, we’ll declare that the observed data are inconsistent with our simulated model.

    "By convention, we often compare the proportion we just calculated to 0.05. If the proportion of simulated statistics greater than or equal to the observed statistic is sufficiently small (less than or equal to 0.05), then this is evidence against Emily's model. Conceptually, you may think of this as the case where less than 5% of simulated values are as far or farther away from what we had expected. If this is not the case, we don’t have any reason to doubt Emily’s model. \n",

    "Therapeutic touch fell out of use after this experiment, which was eventually accepted into one of the premier medical journals. TT practitioners hit back and accused Emily and her family of tampering with the results, while some claimed that Emily's bad spiritual mood towards therapeutic touch made it difficult to read her HEF. Whatever it may be, Emily's experiment is a classic example about how anyone, with the right resources, can test anything they want!"
